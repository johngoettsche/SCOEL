This is Version 9.4.0 of the Icon Program Library, slightly modified
for Unicon.

For on-line documentation, see
	http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v940/library/ipl.htm

Reusable library procedures are compiled during the Unicon install
and stored in the lib/ subdirectory.  For example programs, you
are on your own.  For packages, there is generally a Makefile.

The MT-Icon portions of the library (the m* directories) are for
use with miconx and the execution monitoring facilities; they
are described in the book published by Springer, "Program
Monitoring and Visualization: an Exploratory Approach".
