This directory contains tests for a C preprocessor, pp, which is based
on the ANSI C standard. pp normally is included only as a part of rtt, but it
can be built as a separate processor.  See src/preproc.

The subdirectory stand here has the expected output of the tests that are
run via the Makefile. The actual output is put in local.

This preprocessor has an non-standard multi-line macro definition that
allows embedded preprocessor directives. This feature is used in the
files:

    begdef.c
    errmac10.c
    errmac20.c
    errmac4.c
    glnargs.h  (used in glnargs.c)
    glnmulti.c
    macnest.c
    paste.c
    recurse.c
    redef.c
    stringiz.c
    undef.c
    wh_sp.c

Most tests always produce the same output, but there are a few exceptions.
One exception is

   special.c

it tests __DATE__ and __TIME__.

The other exceptions only differ from platform to platform. The test

   sys.c

include the system include file ctype.h. In addition, command line
error tests may produce different "usage" messages on platforms where
pp supports platform-specific command line options.
