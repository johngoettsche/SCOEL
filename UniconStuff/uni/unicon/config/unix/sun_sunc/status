Comments:

	This is a configuration for Solaris using the SunPro C compiler.
	It is VERY IMPORTANT that /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc precede /usr/ucb/cc
	in your search path -- or that /usr/ucb/cc be absent from the path.

	This configuration uses no Berkeley or SunOS 4.x compatibility files;
	it was built with PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin.
	The Makefiles assume that OpenWindows is in /usr/openwin.

	Tested on: Solaris 2.6
