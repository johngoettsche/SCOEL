Unicon: Frequently Asked Questions
</h1>

This FAQ has been prepared by Clint Jeffery with input from Brian Rogoff
and Chris Harris.  Last updated September 11, 2012. Thanks to
Jovana Milutinovich the <a href="http://science.webhostinggeeks.com/unicon-cesto-postavljana-pitanja">FAQ is available in Serbian</a>.

<dl>
<dt>1. What is Unicon?</dt>
<dd>Unicon is a "modern dialect" descending
    from the Icon programming language.  Unicon incorporates numerous new
    features and extensions to make the Icon language more suitable for a
    broad range of real-world applications.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>2. What does the name "Unicon" mean?
</dt><dd>Version 1 of Unicon referred to a set of UNIX extensions for Icon written
    by Shamim Mohamed.  More recently the name has been broadened to refer to
    a unified extended dialect of Icon.  The POSIX system interface
    has been ported to Windows, and the language also bundles OOP,
    ODBC database support, and other extensions.
    It also means: the <em>un</em>Icon.
</dd><br>

<dt>3. Why aren't you calling it Icon Version 10?</dt>
<dd>The University of Arizona distributes Icon, and they are neither
    responsible for, nor endorse Unicon.  Do not ask them questions
    about it.  The current version of Icon is 9.5.  The Icon Project
    is welcome to incorporate features from Unicon if they wish.
</dd><br>

<dt>4. Is this a hostile takeover attempt?</dt>
<dd>No.  Icon Project at University of Arizona is unaffected by
Unicon.  We will cooperate with them on Icon-related matters.
We did not want to invent a new language at all, but are marketing
Unicon as a new language at the insistence of the Icon Project.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>5.  What is Unicon, <em>really</em>?</dt>
<dd>
Unicon is a superset of Icon with "looser slots and a higher payback", to
use Las Vegas terminology.  It adds objects, networking and file systems
access, concurrency, execution monitoring and visualization, and an ODBC
database interface that operates on local files or
across a network with SQL database servers.  It is portable to (minimally)
Linux, MS Windows, Mac OS X, IRIX and Solaris environments.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>6. What is the motivation for Unicon?</dt>
<dd>

We wish to develop, improve, and promote Icon-style goal-directed very high
level languages.  One way to do this is to do a new implementation of an
existing language; Icon translators into C code and Java code are examples
of this approach.  Another way to do this is to design a new language that
is not constrained by the syntax or semantics of an existing language; the
<a href="http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/%7Ejeffery/godiva/">Godiva programming language</a>
is (to some extent) an example this approach.
Unicon pursues a third path: that of evolving an existing
language to support new capabilities in a manner that is as compatible
and consistent with the original design philosophy as possible.  <br><br>

</dd>


<dt>7. What's with the ludicrous slogan "more Icon than Icon"?</dt>
<dd>

It is a parody of the Tyrell Corporation's slogan from the movie <u>Blade
Runner</u>.  As one example, Icon provides support in its run-time system for
type conversions and defaulting of parameters that comprises some of the
basic character of the language.  Yet at the source-level, writing
procedures that coerce their parameters is clumsy.  We have extended to the
source language some constructs discovered in the implementation; this is
(part of) how Icon was carved out of Snobol4's legacy.  Beyond this minor
detail, you can view the slogan as a homage to "feature bloat", or conclude
that the slogan fits the added high level capabilities provided by
Unicon.
<br><br>

</dd>

<dt>8. Who is responsible for Unicon?</dt>
<dd>

Unicon was originally the creation of Clinton Jeffery and Shamim Mohamed.
Federico Balbi has contributed an ODBC interface.
Robert Parlett contributed the implementation of packages, along with
substantive programming tools and class libraries that are distributed
as part of Unicon. Other contributors are welcome.  Jafar Al Gharaibeh
has contributed concurrency and extensive improvements to the 3D graphics
facilities. Unicon has a
<a href="http://unicon.org/citizens.html">Citizens page</a> that shows many other contributions.
<br><br>

</dd>


<dt>9. Where is the Unicon language definition?</dt>
<dd>

Unicon is described in an open document book by Clinton Jeffery,
Shamim Mohamed, Jafar Al Gharaibeh,
Robert Parlett, and Ray Pereda, titled "Programming with Unicon". A PDF format
draft copy of this book is available on the unicon.org web site.  Hard copies
are available. A technical
report (UTR #8) summarizes the language.
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt>10. Why aren't Unicon's basic types classes?</dt>
<dd>

Types that Unicon inherits from Icon will retain compatibility with Icon.
They may eventually gain class status, meaning they'll have attributes and
operations, and can be subclassed.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>11. Why isn't data structure X a built-in?</dt>
<dd>

The built-in types are widely-used, general-purpose information elements and
structures.  Every program pays for their presence in the runtime system
whether they are used or not.  New built-in types may occasionally appear,
but most data structures will be added as classes.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>12. Why aren't there abstract classes in Unicon?</dt>
<dd> There isn't a strong need for these in a dynamically typed language.
     Robert Parlett has added syntax to support abstract methods; we may
     at some point add syntax for declaring an abstract class.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>13. Is there a convention for naming classes and methods?</dt>
<dd>

The Java/Smalltalk style of capitalizing the first letter of a class name
and using lower case for method names is endorsed, but not yet mandated or
universally adhered to in class libraries.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>14. How compatible is Unicon with Icon?</dt>
<dd>

Well, it is a superset in principle, but if you get technical you will find
incompatibilities.  The reserved words added in Unicon are no longer legal
variable names: words like "class" and "method".  This breaks for example,
a grand total of 1 of the 223 files in the Icon Program Library procs/
directory, requiring its variable named "method" to be changed to "Method"
(or whatever). The Unicon translator
generates out Icon as an intermediate step; for regular Icon source the
resulting virtual machine code is very similar.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>15. How compatible is Unicon with Idol?</dt>
<dd>

Pretty compatible, and vastly simpler. The $ syntax is available but not
required in ordinary invocation.  The full yacc-based parser is more correct
than the Idol parser.  The file extension changed from .iol to .icn.  No
ugly idolcode.env/ subdirectory is created. Code from a .icn file is stored
in a single corresponding .u file.  An accompanying DBM database stores class
information on a per-directory bases for use in inheritance resolution.  DBM
databases along the IPATH are searched for superclass information.
<br><br>
</dd>

<dt>16. What do I have to do to build Windows Unicon?</dt>
<dd>
At present the recommended compiler is MinGW32 version of the GNU C compiler.
A 64-bit Windows configuration has been produced but is not very mature yet.
MS Visual C++ has been used for production releases in the past and the sources
might be updated to work with that compiler, with modest effort.
Other C compilers will require nontrivial
effort to develop new configuration files under the config/win32 directory,
comparable to (and possibly starting from) config/win32/gcc or config/win32/msvc.
<p>
After you unpack the source files, you have to add the Unicon bin directory
to your path, or the <code>make</code> or <code>nmake</code> command will
not build all the way successfully. This author's experience is that the
Windows build process is at present unfortunately not for the faint of heart.
</p></dd>

<dt>17. How do I build noweb with Windows (Un)Icon?</dt>
<dd>(provided by Chris Harris)
<ol>
<li> Get the noweb distribution and extract all of the Icon files in the
	icon/ directory.
</li><li> Build each one using "nticont <filename>"
</filename></li><li> Copy all of the .exe files built in step #2 into your noweb/bin/
directory.
</li><li> Delete old DOS Icon noweb .exe's if you are putting in new Windows .exe's
</li></ol>
</dd><br>

<dt>18. How can I use an assert() expression in my programs?</dt>
<dd>assert(expr) is normally written as expr | stop("expr failed...").
    Unicon does not provide a built-in macro or control structure for assert.
    If your system supports m4 you can use it to provide an assert() macro,
    as in the following example provided by Kostas Oikonomou:
<pre>	m4 -D assert='($$1) | stop("Assertion failure on line ", &amp;line, "!")'
</pre>
    This filter might work on .m4 files to produce .icn files, or might be
    used in conjunction with noweb, as in Kostas' example makefile rule below.
    Note that this example assumes GNU m4, which can process your code
    without accidentally firing off built-in m4 macros if you supply the
    --prefix-builtins flag:
<pre>%.icn : %.nw
	notangle $&lt; | \
	m4 --prefix-builtins \
	 -D assert='($$1) | stop("Assertion failure on line ", &amp;line, "!")'\
	 - &gt; $@
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>19. My SQL/ODBC open() mode "q" is failing.  Why?</dt>
<dd>Well, first, it should be mode "o", not mode "q"; this is a change
not yet reflected in the Unicon book public PDF file. Next, ODBC open()
will fail if Unicon binaries are built without ODBC facilities.  Third,
the ODBC Data Source Name and related configuration must be correct on
your platform (e.g. in the Control Panel for ODBC), lastly you must have
setup a valid username and password.</dd> <br>

<dt>20. Why haven't Icon and Unicon become more popular?
</dt><dd>

Boy, what a piece of flame-bait!  It is simply speculation or sour grapes,
but some people might reasonably speculate that Icon and Unicon
would be a lot more popular if they were invented at AT&amp;T, Microsoft,
or IBM.  Icon and Unicon might be a lot more popular if they did
something other languages really can't easily do (niche) rather than simply
doing things more elegantly.  Icon and Unicon's inventors have
never invested heavily in marketing their wares, viewing them as a
by-product of research rather than a product to be pushed. Similarly, Icon's
inventor could easily claim victory by noting the success of languages
influenced by Icon (e.g. generators or Icon-style strings present in other
languages like Python), rather than claiming defeat by deploring the failure
of the mainstream to take advantage of goal-directed evaluation or the best
collection of data types found in any language.  Clearly, adopters of this
language family love these features with sometimes extreme levels of passion,
but they are apparently often missed by the casual observer.
